## 2026-03-14 - Optimize isFullDocument string allocation
**Learning:** Brainstorm server receives full HTML screens that can be multi-megabytes. Calling `toLowerCase()` on the entire string before checking the first few characters for `<!doctype` causes huge unnecessary memory allocations and blocks the event loop.
**Action:** Only substring the first few characters (e.g., 20) of large text payloads before calling string transformation functions like `toLowerCase()` when doing prefix checks.

## 2026-03-16 - Optimize String replacement overhead for large strings
**Learning:** In the Brainstorm server, when modifying multi-megabyte HTML strings generated as screens, using \`String.prototype.replace\` (even with a function replacement) creates a massive overhead. Benchmarks show it takes ~27ms, compared to just ~0.03ms when using \`lastIndexOf\` combined with string \`slice\`.
**Action:** Always prefer \`indexOf\`/\`lastIndexOf\` combined with \`slice\` when inserting or replacing content within potentially huge string payloads instead of using regex or string \`replace\`.
