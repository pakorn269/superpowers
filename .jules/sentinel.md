## 2025-02-15 - [Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking in Brainstorm Server]
**Vulnerability:** The local WebSocket server in `skills/brainstorming/scripts/server.cjs` allowed any website to connect and send mock choice events to Claude without an Origin check.
**Learning:** Local dev tools that bind WebSocket servers must enforce strict `Origin` validation, as browsers automatically forward credentials and can silently connect to localhost services.
**Prevention:** Always validate `req.headers['origin']` against allowed hosts (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or configured `HOST`) in the `upgrade` handshake of custom WebSocket servers.

## 2026-03-24 - [Unbounded WebSocket Buffer Memory Exhaustion (DoS)]
**Vulnerability:** The custom WebSocket parser in `skills/brainstorming/scripts/server.cjs` continuously appended incoming chunks to a buffer without any size limit. A malicious client could stream incomplete frames indefinitely, causing the server to allocate memory until it crashes (OOM/DoS).
**Learning:** Custom stream-based protocol parsers must always enforce explicit maximum buffer/payload size limits. The limit must be checked *after* the frame-consuming loop to avoid falsely triggering on legitimate bursts of valid frames.
**Prevention:** Define a `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` constant (e.g., 10MB) at module level. After the frame-processing loop in `socket.on('data')`, check `buffer.length > MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` and respond with WS close code 1009 (Message Too Big), then call `socket.destroy()`.

## 2026-03-24 - [DOM-based XSS in helper.js indicator]
**Vulnerability:** The brainstorm helper script used `innerHTML` to render user-controlled option labels into the status indicator, allowing XSS if a brainstorm option contained HTML.
**Learning:** Never use `innerHTML` to render any data that originates from user input or LLM-generated content. Use `textContent` or explicit DOM node creation instead.
**Prevention:** Replace `element.innerHTML = '<span>' + label + '</span>'` with `document.createElement` + `textContent` assignment.

## 2026-03-25 - [Insecure Random Port Selection]
**Vulnerability:** The brainstorm server used `Math.random()` to dynamically select a port for binding. Because `Math.random()` is predictable, an attacker running malicious JavaScript in a background tab or another application could guess the assigned port and attempt cross-site attacks before the owner interacts.
**Learning:** Avoid `Math.random()` for any security-sensitive logic like local port assignment, token generation, or IDs.
**Prevention:** Always use `crypto.randomInt(min, max)` for cryptographically secure integer generation.

## 2026-03-26 - [DNS Rebinding in Brainstorm Server HTTP Handler]
**Vulnerability:** The local HTTP server in `skills/brainstorming/scripts/server.cjs` served files without validating the `Host` header. This allows a malicious website to perform a DNS rebinding attack, pointing its domain to `127.0.0.1` and reading local user screens via standard HTTP requests.
**Learning:** Local dev tools binding HTTP servers must validate the `Host` header to prevent DNS rebinding attacks where malicious sites can query local endpoints.
**Prevention:** Always validate `req.headers.host` against allowed hosts (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, or a configured `HOST`). If `HOST` is `0.0.0.0`, the strict check can be bypassed to allow LAN access, but loopback and explicit domains must otherwise be enforced.

## 2026-03-27 - [Event Source Spoofing Vulnerability]
**Vulnerability:** The brainstorm server allowed untrusted WebSocket clients to spoof the `source` property of events by providing a payload like `{"type": "click", "source": "admin"}`. This was caused by spreading the event object *after* the trusted `source` property in `JSON.stringify({ source: 'user-event', ...event })`.
**Learning:** When merging untrusted input objects with trusted overrides (e.g., assigning a secure source or role), ensure the trusted properties are placed after the spread operator (e.g., `{ ...untrusted, role: 'trusted-user' }`) to prevent spoofing by the incoming object payload.
**Prevention:** Always place trusted properties after the spread operator when merging untrusted payloads.
